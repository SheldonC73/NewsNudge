Feedback System: Allow users to rate the recommended articles, which can be used to further improve the recommendation engine.
Technologies:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or Vue.js)
Backend: Python (Django or Flask), Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch)
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
Steps:

Design and implement the frontend using React.js or Vue.js.
Develop the backend using Django or Flask.
